## Commit Message
feat(git-hooks): Implement post-commit hook for detailed commit logging

- Added a post-commit hook to automatically generate detailed commit logs.
- Logs include full commit details in a markdown file (`commit_$COMMIT_HASH.md`) and a summary in the main commit log (`commit_log.md`).
- Logs contain commit hash, author, date, branch, commit message, and changed files.
- Automatically stages, commits, and optionally pushes commit logs to the repository.
- Added security checks to prevent committing sensitive files (e.g., `.env`, `secrets`).
- Prevents recursive commits by using a skip marker file.
- Commits both the individual commit log file and the main log file.
